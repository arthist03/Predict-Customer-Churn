# 📊 Customer Churn Prediction Model

> 🚀 Predict which customers are likely to leave your business and take proactive steps to retain them!

## 📝 Overview
In this project, we’ll develop a predictive model to identify customers with a high likelihood of churning (leaving the service). Understanding customer churn allows businesses to take action and reduce turnover effectively.

**Key Components:**
- **Predictive Modeling** 🧠
- **Data Collection & Preparation** 📊
- **Feature Engineering & Model Training** 🛠️
- **Interpretation of Results** 🔍

## 💻 Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   https://github.com/arthist03/Predict-Customer-Churn.git


## 🔄 High-Level Process

Here's the workflow to create a customer churn prediction model:

### 1️⃣ Understand the Business Case
   **Goal**: Detect potential churners early, allowing for proactive actions to retain them.

### 2️⃣ Data Collection & Cleaning
   - Load the dataset from IBM's Telcom Customer Churn Dataset.
   - Clean the data: handle missing values, convert data types, and drop irrelevant columns.

### 3️⃣ Feature Engineering
   - Drop non-informative columns like `customerID`.
   - Convert numerical features to numeric format.
   - Transform categorical variables into numeric using label encoding.

### 4️⃣ Model Building
   - Split the data into training and testing sets.
   - Train a Logistic Regression model to classify churn.

### 5️⃣ Interpretation of Results
   - Analyze feature coefficients to understand the impact on churn.
   - Derive actionable insights from the prediction results.

## 📈 Visualization & Animations

Use **Plotly** for data visualization, and try **ipywidgets** in Jupyter Notebook to create animations of model training!

### Example Animations
- **Churn Distribution**: Show the proportion of churned vs. non-churned customers using a pie chart animation.
- **Feature Importance**: Visualize the effect of variables with a bar chart animation, showcasing features that have the most influence on churn predictions.

## ⚙️ Tools & Libraries
- **Python** 🐍: Programming language for machine learning.
- **Pandas** 🐼: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **Plotly** 📊: Interactive data visualizations.
- **Scikit-Learn** 🤖: Model training and evaluation.

## 🎉 Results & Findings
With an 80% accuracy score, our logistic regression model performs well in identifying likely churners. Key insights from the model:
- **Contract Type**: Month-to-month customers are more likely to churn.
- **Fiber Optic**: Surprisingly, this internet type has a higher churn rate, signaling deeper investigation.
